This code is explained in 3 main parts:

Data Preprocessing (Part 1):

Imports libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
Reads the "Churn_Modelling.csv" dataset containing customer information and their churn status (whether they left the service).
Selects relevant features (columns 3 to 12) and the target variable (churn status in column 13).
Creates dummy variables for categorical features ("Geography" and "Gender") to improve model performance.
Drops the original categorical columns ("Geography" and "Gender") to avoid redundancy.
Splits the data into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).
Applies standard scaling to normalize the features in the training and testing sets, ensuring all features have a similar range.
Building the Artificial Neural Network (Part 2):

Initializes a sequential model, a common architecture for ANNs.
Defines the layers of the network:
An input layer with 11 neurons (matching the number of features).
Two hidden layers with 6 neurons each, using rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation for non-linearity.
An output layer with 1 neuron, using sigmoid activation to predict the probability of churn (0 or 1).
Configures the model with:
Optimizer: "Adamax" for efficient gradient descent during training.
Loss function: "binary_crossentropy" suitable for binary classification problems.
Metrics: "accuracy" to measure the model's performance in predicting churn correctly.
Trains the model on the training data for 100 epochs (iterations), fitting the model to recognize churn patterns.
Evaluating the Model (Part 3):

Predicts churn probabilities on the testing data using the trained model.
Applies a threshold (0.5) to convert predicted probabilities into churn classifications (0 for not churning, 1 for churning).
Evaluates the model's performance using a confusion matrix, visualizing the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
Calculates the accuracy score, a metric indicating the overall percentage of correct predictions.
Plots the training and validation accuracy/loss curves to visualize the model's learning process and potential for overfitting.
This code demonstrates the development and evaluation of an ANN model for predicting customer churn in a banking context.
And in last we also checked for best hyperparameter value( Number of hidden layer and Neurons) using Keras Tuner.
